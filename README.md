## Installation

You can get the latest binaries from [releases](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker/releases) or follow the install from scratch instructions below.

1. Clone the repo.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker.git
    cd torrust-tracker
    ```

2. Build the source code.

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Usage

- Run the torrust-tracker once to create the `config.toml` file:

    ```bash
    ./target/release/torrust-tracker
    ```

- Edit the newly created config.toml file according to your liking, see [configuration documentation](https://torrust.github.io/torrust-documentation/torrust-tracker/config/). Eg:

    ```toml
    log_level = "info"
    mode = "public"
    db_driver = "Sqlite3"
    db_path = "data.db"
    announce_interval = 120
    min_announce_interval = 120
    max_peer_timeout = 900
    on_reverse_proxy = false
    external_ip = "0.0.0.0"
    tracker_usage_statistics = true
    persistent_torrent_completed_stat = false
    inactive_peer_cleanup_interval = 600
    remove_peerless_torrents = true

    [[udp_trackers]]
    enabled = false
    bind_address = "0.0.0.0:6969"

    [[http_trackers]]
    enabled = true
    bind_address = "0.0.0.0:6969"
    ssl_enabled = false
    ssl_cert_path = ""
    ssl_key_path = ""

    [http_api]
    enabled = true
    bind_address = "127.0.0.1:1212"

    [http_api.access_tokens]
    admin = "MyAccessToken"
    ```

- Run the torrust-tracker again:

    ```bash
    ./target/release/torrust-tracker
    ```

### Tracker URL

Your tracker announce URL will be dependent on your bindings:

```TEXT
udp://{tracker-ip:port} 
```

and/or

```TEXT
http://{tracker-ip:port}/announce
```

and/or

```TEXT  
https://{tracker-ip:port}/announce
```

In private & private_listed mode, tracker keys are added after the tracker URL like:

```TEXT
https://{tracker-ip:port}/announce/{key}
```
