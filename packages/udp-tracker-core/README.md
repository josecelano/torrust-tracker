# BitTorrent UDP Tracker Core library

A library with the core functionality needed to implement a BitTorrent UDP tracker.

You usually don’t need to use this library directly. Instead, you should use the [Torrust Tracker](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker). If you want to build your own tracker, you can use this library as the core functionality.

> **Disclaimer**: This library is actively under development. We’re currently extracting and refining common types from the[Torrust Tracker](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker) to make them available to the BitTorrent community in Rust. While these types are functional, they are not yet ready for use in production or third-party projects.
